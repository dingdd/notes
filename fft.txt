Fast Fourier Transforms: A Tutorial Review and a State of the Art

	Section 7.2: 
		FFT Gauss and splitradix algorithm

	Section 7.4:
		twiddle factors
		
FIR filters (finite impulse response)
	linear phase properties
	The nature of FIR filters has the ability to “smooth out” these stray values with linear phase properties.
